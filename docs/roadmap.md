The most important checks have been already implemented and are listed in 
[this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wcr2fjzwQ7NmxvqZEbiT7GVck8dLyWG2KvzmOxXAVfs/edit?usp=sharing). They include validations on the structure of the metadata and the body, as well as semantic validations between them, like checking that an INFO field fully matches the description in the header.

## Future work

### User experience

* Configuration for the way errors are listed (display/hide duplicates)
* Make errors more understandable (we welcome feedback and suggestions!)

### Complex validations and quality check

* If a pedigree file is provided, the number of mendelian errors could be counted

Please read the document linked above for a more detailed list of complex validations and QC.
